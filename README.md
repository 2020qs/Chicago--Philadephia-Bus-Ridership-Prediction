# Bus Ridership Analysis and Prediction

CTA has 1,864 buses that make about 19,237 trips a day and serve 10,768 bus stops, according to the latest official tally in 2017. However, there is not much publicly available information on how the bus service has been used. What are the areas with lots of ridership? Are there any interesting spatial patterns? Are there areas with potential ridership demand, but are not accessible to a bus stop?

Through our project, we hope to gain a better understanding of the bus ridership service and usage and apply our insights to improve planning of bus stations. We will find boarding and alighting patterns across geographies and sociodemographics to select indicators of ridership demand. From there, we will build a prediction model to help predict ridership demand and demonstrate a use case on another city without ridership information. Finally, we will visualize a dashboard to help city officials identify areas in need of better bus services.
