# Bus Ridership Analysis and Prediction

CTA has 1,864 buses that make about 19,237 trips a day and serve 10,768 bus stops, according to the latest official tally in 2017. However, there is not much publicly available information on how the bus service has been used. What are the areas with lots of ridership? Are there any interesting spatial patterns? Are there areas with potential ridership demand, but are not accessible to a bus stop? This questions are even more important for cities without easily-accessible ridership data.

Through our project, we hope to gain a better understanding of the bus ridership service and usage and apply our insights to improve planning of bus stations. With Chicago's data, we will find boarding and alighting patterns across geographies and sociodemographics to select indicators of ridership demand. From there, we will build a prediction model to help predict ridership demand and demonstrate a use case on another city without ridership information. For our project we select Philadelphia. Finally, we will visualize a dashboard to help city officials identify areas in need of better bus services in the city.

This project acts as a preliminary proof-of-concept for the use of ridership prediction model in allocation bus services rather than a ready-to-use planning tool. We will discuss the limitations and next steps for transportation planners to build on in the future for the possibility of a more comprehensive and more useful tool.

# Analysis
Our analysis is consisted of several parts: data preparation, data exploration, regression and prediction, use case scenario, and conclusion.

## Data preparation
For this project we need data to support our model building and use case discussion. We collected a month-long [ridership data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/CTA-Ridership-Avg-Weekday-Bus-Stop-Boardings-in-Oc/mq3i-nnqe) in 2012 from OpenDataChicago, socioeconomic data from census' 2015-2019 American Community Survey, and spatial features from OpenStreetMap.
